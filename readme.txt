You will need to transfer the files here to your calculator:

https://github.com/CE-Programming/libraries/releases/latest

These are just the C libraries that checkers uses. You only need to transfer them once, and then all C programs will work fine :)

Then use TI Connect CE or TILP to transfer the program.
